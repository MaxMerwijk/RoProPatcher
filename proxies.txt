# Working RoPro proxies (as of 2025)
# Note: These may go down over time, you might need to find new ones
# or set up your own proxy server

# Example working proxies (you'll need to find current ones):
# proxy1.ropro.workers.dev
# api.ropro-proxy.com
# ropro.bypass.sh

# For now, using a placeholder - you'll need to find working proxies
# or set up your own reverse proxy that forwards requests to api.ropro.io
# with the required headers (ropro-verification, ropro-id)
